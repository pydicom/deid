Here is a quick example to show using deid to update a frame of reference UID,
and instance UIDs across a set of datasets. We aren't doing any filtering, we are just going to
change field with a value derived from a function. This example
was derived based on a prompt in [this pull request](https://github.com/pydicom/contrib-pydicom/pull/14).
If you are interested in the code for this example, it's available
[here](https://github.com/pydicom/deid/tree/master/examples/dicom/header-manipulation).
Let's get started!

## Imports
We first import the functions that we need

```python
from deid.dicom import get_files, replace_identifiers
from deid.utils import get_installdir
from deid.data import get_dataset
import os
```

This will get a set of example cookie dicoms

```python
base = get_dataset('dicom-cookies')
dicom_files = list(get_files(base)) # todo : consider using generator functionality
```

This is the function to get identifiers. Identifiers are basically a dictionary
of header values extracted from each dicom, indexed by the complete file path.

```python
from deid.dicom import get_identifiers
items = get_identifiers(dicom_files)
```

If you want to expand sequences, ask for it:

```python
items = get_identifiers(dicom_files, expand_sequences=True)
```

When you expand sequences, they are flattened out in the data structure.
For example:


```python
 'ReferencedImageSequence__ReferencedSOPClassUID': '111111111111111111',
 'ReferencedImageSequence__ReferencedSOPInstanceUID': '111111111111111',
 'ReferencedPerformedProcedureStepSequence__InstanceCreationDate': '22222222',
 'ReferencedPerformedProcedureStepSequence__InstanceCreationTime': '22222222',
 'ReferencedPerformedProcedureStepSequence__InstanceCreatorUID': 'xxxxxxx',
 'ReferencedPerformedProcedureStepSequence__ReferencedSOPClassUID': 'xxxxxxxxxx',
 'ReferencedPerformedProcedureStepSequence__ReferencedSOPInstanceUID': 'xxxxxxxx',
```

The function we will use for the example will perform an action to generate a uid, 
but you can also use it to communicate with databases, APIs, or do something like 
save the original (and newly generated one) in some (IRB approvied) place

## The Deid Recipe

The process of updating header values means writing a series of actions
in the deid recipe, in this folder the file [deid.dicom](deid.dicom) has the
following content:

```
FORMAT dicom

%header

REPLACE StudyInstanceUID func:generate_uid
REPLACE SeriesInstanceUID func:generate_uid
ADD FrameOfReferenceUID func:generate_uid
```

The main difference between REPLACE and ADD here is that REPLACE won't add
a value if it doesn't already exist.  Let's create an instance of our recipe:

```python
# Create the DeidRecipe Instance from deid.dicom
from deid.config import DeidRecipe
recipe = DeidRecipe('deid.dicom')
```

Here are a few different ways to interact:

```python
# To see an entire (raw in a dictionary) recipe just look at
recipe.deid

# What is the format?
recipe.get_format()
# dicom

# What actions do we want to do on the header?
recipe.get_actions()

[{'action': 'REPLACE',
  'field': 'StudyInstanceUID',
  'value': 'func:generate_uid'},
 {'action': 'REPLACE',
  'field': 'SeriesInstanceUID',
  'value': 'func:generate_uid'},
 {'action': 'REPLACE',
  'field': 'FrameOfReferenceUID',
  'value': 'func:generate_uid'}]

# We can filter to an action type (not useful here, we only have one type)
recipe.get_actions(action='REPLACE')

# or we can filter to a field
recipe.get_actions(field='FrameOfReferenceUID')
[{'action': 'REPLACE',
  'field': 'FrameOfReferenceUID',
  'value': 'func:generate_uid'}]

# and logically, both (not useful here)
recipe.get_actions(field='PatientID', action="REMOVE")
```

Our recipe instance is ready to go. From the above we are saying we want to replace the fields above with the
output from the generate_uid function, which is expected in the item dict. Let's write
that next.

## Write Your Function

```python
def generate_uid(item, value, field, dicom):
    '''This function will generate a uuid! You can expect it to be passed
       the dictionary of items extracted from the dicom (and your function)
       and variables, the original value (func:generate_uid) and the field
       name you are applying it to.
    '''
    import uuid
    prefix = field.lower().replace(' ', " ")
    return prefix + "-" + str(uuid.uuid4())

```

As stated in the docstring, you can expect it to be passed the custom lookup
of items extracted from the dicom (your function, variables, any values or fields
lists). The original value (func:generate_uid) is also included with the field name you are applying it to.

## Update Your Items

How do we update the items? Remember, the action is: 

```
REPLACE StudyInstanceUID func:generate_uid
```

so the key for each item in items needs to be 'generate_uid." Just do this:

```python
for item in items:
    items[item]['generate_uid'] = generate_uid
```

## Replace identifiers
We are ready to go! Now let's generate the cleaned files! It will output to a 
temporary directory. 

```python
cleaned_files = replace_identifiers(dicom_files=dicom_files,
                                    deid=recipe,
                                    ids=items)
```

If your data was extracted with sequences expanded, those
same sequences will be checked for cleaning, but only if you set `strip_sequences`
to False.

```python
cleaned_files = replace_identifiers(dicom_files=dicom_files,
                                    deid=recipe,
                                    ids=items,
                                    strip_sequences=False)
```

See [here](https://github.com/pydicom/deid/tree/master/examples/dicom/header-manipulation/func-sequence-replace) for the code for the sequences replacement example. Note that expansion of sequences is not currently supported for operations that remove or add a value (ADD, REMOVE, JITTER).
You can load in a cleaned file to see what was done.

```python
from pydicom import read_file
test_file = read_file(cleaned_files[0])
print(test_file)

# test_file (subset of changed)
# (0020, 000d) Study Instance UID                  UI: studyinstanceuid-022f82f4-e9df-4533-b237-6ab563dfaf56
# (0020, 000e) Series Instance UID                 UI: seriesinstanceuid-6a3a0ac8-22fd-449f-9779-2580cf2897bd
# (0020, 0052) Frame of Reference UID              UI: frameofreferenceuid-0693b1fa-9144-4a1d-9cb7-82da56e462ce
```

Finally, if you want to write to a different output folder, here is how to do that:

```python
cleaned_files = replace_identifiers(dicom_files=dicom_files,
                                    deid=recipe,
                                    ids=items,
                                    output_folder='/tmp/')

# Force overwrite (be careful!)
cleaned_files = replace_identifiers(dicom_files=dicom_files,
                                    deid=recipe,
                                    ids=items,
                                    output_folder='/tmp/',
                                    overwrite=True)

```

That's it! If you need any help, please open an issue. Full code for the
example above is [available here](https://github.com/pydicom/deid/tree/master/examples/dicom/header-manipulation).
