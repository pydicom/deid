# Get Identifiers (GET)

A get request using the deid module will return the headers found in a particular dataset. Let's walk through these steps. As we did in the [loading](loading.md), the first step was to load a dicom dataset:

```
from deid.data import get_dataset
from deid.dicom import get_files

base = get_dataset("dicom-cookies")
dicom_files = list(get_files(base))
DEBUG Found 7 contender files in dicom-cookies
DEBUG Checking 7 dicom files for validation.
Found 7 valid dicom files
```

We now have our small dataset that we want to de-identify! The first step is to get the identifiers. By default, we will return all of them. That call will look like this:

```
from deid.dicom import get_identifiers
ids = get_identifiers(dicom_files)
```

By default, any Sequences (lists of items) within the files are expanded and provided. This means that a Sequence with header value `AdditionalData` and item `Modality` will be returned as `AdditionalData_Modality`. If you want to disable this and not return expanded sequences:

```
ids = get_identifiers(dicom_files=dicom_files,
                      expand_sequences=False)
```

We will see debug output for each, indicating that we found a particular number of fields:

```
$ ids=get_identifiers(dicom_files)
DEBUG entity id: cookie-47
DEBUG item id: 1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.4.8323329.5323.1495927169.335276
DEBUG Found 27 defined fields for image4.dcm

DEBUG entity id: cookie-47

DEBUG Found 27 defined fields for image3.dcm
DEBUG entity id: cookie-47
DEBUG item id: 1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.4.8323329.5342.1495927169.3131
DEBUG Found 27 defined fields for image1.dcm
DEBUG entity id: cookie-47
DEBUG item id: 1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.4.8323329.5329.1495927169.580351
DEBUG Found 27 defined fields for image5.dcm
```

Since a data structure is returned indexed by an entity id and then item (eg, patient --> image). under the hood this means that we use fields from the header to use as the index for entity id and item id. Id you don't change the defaults, the entity_id is `PatientID` and item id is `SOPInstanceUID`. To change this, just specify in the function:

```

ids = get_identifiers(dicom_files,
                      entity_id="PatientFullName",
                      item_id="InstanceUID")
```


## Organization
Let's take a closer look at how this is organized. If you notice, the above seems to be able to identify entity and items. This is because in the default, the configuration has set an entity id to be the `PatientID` and the item the `SOPInstanceUID`. This is how it is organized in the returned result - the entity is the first lookup key:

```
# We found one entity
len(ids)
1

# The entity id is cookie-47
ids.keys()
dict_keys(['cookie-47'])
```

and then below that, the data is indexed by the item id:

```
list(ids['cookie-47'].keys())
['1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.4.8323329.5360.1495927170.640947',
 '1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.4.8323329.5348.1495927170.228989',
 '1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.4.8323329.5329.1495927169.580351',
 '1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.4.8323329.5342.1495927169.3131',

 '1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.4.8323329.5323.1495927169.335276',
 '1.2.276.0.7230010.3.1.4.8323329.5335.1495927169.763866']
```
**note** that I only made it a list for prettier printing. 


### Why this organization?
We have this organization because by default, the software doesn't know what headers it will find in the dicom files, and it also doesn't know the number of (possibly) different entities (eg, a patient) or images (eg, an instance) it will find. For this reason, by default, for dicom we have specified that the entity id is the `PatientID` and the `itemID` is the `SOPInstanceUID`. 


### Header Fields
Then if we look at the data under a particular item id, we see the dicom fields (and corresponding values) found in the data.

```

## Save what you need
Pretty neat! At this point, you have a few options:

### Recipe Interaction
If you want to do more than load in a basic recipe file (e.g., add new actions, use only a subset of groups, or any customization) then you should read about how to [work with recipes](recipes.md).

### Clean Pixels
It's likely that the pixels in the images have burned in annotations, and we can use the header data to flag these images. Thus, before you replace identifiers, you probably want to do this. We have a DicomCleaner class that can flag images for PHI based on matching some header filter criteria, and you can [read about that here](pixels.md). 

### Update Identifiers
Once you are finished with any customization of the recipe, updating identifiers, and/or potentially flagging and quarantining images that have PHI, you should be ready to [update your images](update.md) with new fields based on the deid recipe.
