# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release.
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements**
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

- renamed commands
- deprecated / removed commands
- changed defaults
- backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
- migration guidance (how to convert images?)
- changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)

Referenced versions in headers are tagged on Github, in parentheses are for pypi.
